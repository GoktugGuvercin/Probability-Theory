# Random Variables and Probability Distribution

## Random Variables

* Random variables are used to denote possible incidents that can happen under specific problem domain. A random variable is responsible for storing next random
  event that will happen. However, which one of the events in problem domain will take place is completely uncertain. Probability theory tries to examine the
  probability of their occurence. 
  
* Random variables are classified under two different categories, which are *discrete* and *continuous random variable*. If there exists finite number of events in
  problem domain like rolling a dice, discrete random variable is used. However, when we try to measure and take a record of amount of rainfalls in specific region
  we face infinite number of cases. Hence, such problems are represented by continuous random variable.
