# Random Variables and Probability Distribution

* Random variables are used to denote possible incidents that can happen under specific problem domain. A random variable is responsible for storing next random
  event that will happen. However, which one of the events in problem domain will take place is completely uncertain. Probability theory tries to examine the
  probability of their occurence.
